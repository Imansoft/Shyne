Purpose
Shyne is a digital platform that solves the problem of low visibility, limited opportunities, and weak
industry connections faced by creatives in Ilorin. The platform connects local talents
(photographers, designers, videographers, writers, stylists, artisans, etc.) with agents,
organizations, and clients, enabling them to showcase their work, get discovered, and land
opportunities.

Agents/Clients (event planners, businesses, NGOs, individuals).
Secondary: Administrators (manage platform, approve/remove users, monitor activity).
User Problems & Solutions
Problem: Creatives lack visibility → Solution: Profiles with portfolios, searchable by category, skills,
or location.
Problem: Few opportunities → Solution: Agents can directly contact or post gigs.
